# Scripts

## icons.js

This script is used to generate the react `IconSymbols` component, which contains all of the icons in `src/icons/svg/` as svg symbols.

## tokens.js

A light wrapper around [theo](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/theo) to transform our design tokens in to the various formats that we require.

There are also a few custom transform formats (in `custom-token-format`) that transform the tokens in to a theme, and generate some css classes.
