# Paper

A generic wrapping visual component, used to implement the box-shadow and focus/blur animations.

## Usage guidelines
- Paper should always be used to house content, especially when on a non-white background.
- Use a minimum of 16px padding.
- If you're building out a list type UI, consider using the `Card` component.
