# Avatar

Avatars are used to represent individual users and teams.

## Best practices

- Avatars should be used with a tooltip, that on hover, displays the entity name (A users full name, or a company name). The tooltip should not contain any other information. See also (Tooltips).

## Grouping avatars

Avatars can be grouped into collections, for example when a project has more than one associated freelancer.

No more than five avatars should be grouped together. See also the [Avatar Group](/components/avatar-group) component
